# CS300-DSA-Analysis-and-Design
Developed code and used non-coding development methodologies in algorithmic design and problem solving. Advanced algorithmic designs to evaluate complex data structures to aid in problem solving.

My course project was to create an efficient course information management program. This project stressed the importance of data structures in software architecture. 
Understanding data structures was crucial since they underpinned program data storage, access, and organization. This expertise helped me choose vectors for dynamic data management and hash tables for rapid lookups. 
Data structures clearly affected the program's performance and efficiency, which shaped my problem-solving and software development style.

This project also taught me the value of thorough planning and modular code. Planning before code implementation saves time and effort during debugging and future improvements. 
Breaking difficult tasks into smaller, reusable modules increased code readability and adaptability. Over time, thorough documentation and comments became essential for code comprehension and maintenance. 
This experience changed my software development style to emphasize systematic planning, modularity, and documentation for manageable, legible, and adaptive products. 
My software design philosophy is based on these ideas, making development more efficient and sustainable.
